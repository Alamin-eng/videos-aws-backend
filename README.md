## The AWS backend infrastructure for this project is temporarily deactivated to minimize operational costs. This decision ensures resource efficiency during the development and testing phases. If required, the backend can be reactivated or transitioned to a cost-effective alternative for further use.

Feel free to explore the codebase, and instructions for deployment are available in the Setup section.
